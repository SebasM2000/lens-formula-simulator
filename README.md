# Lens formula simulator

In this project a lens formula simulator was created using *Processing*, with the aim of showing the user through an interactive interface how the focal length, as well as 
the image and the object distances, are calculated. Furthermore, the user can place the object along the x axis so that the software will automatically create a real or a virtual
image and also it will provide the image distance, the object distance, the focal length and the type of image.

The simulator consists of an interface which has the following components:

1. A frame with the lens formula,
2. the image-formed arrow,
3. the object arrow,
4. grid view,
5. a second frame with the automatic calculations,
6. the type of image formed,
7. two options of the lens type: convergent and divergent.

A better representation is presented as the following:

We hope you enjoy and improve this simulator!
